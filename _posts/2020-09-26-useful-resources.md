This is a collection of resources (links, books, ...) that I find particularly good. 
They made everything simple and clear to me. A huge thank you to their authors.

  - Git [Tom Preston-Werner  - The Git Parable](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html)
  - Data Science [Jake VanderPlas - Python Data Science Handbook](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html). The book was released in 2016, so some of the APIs may have changed a bit (pandas, matplotlib), yet it remains an amazing tour of the Data Science stack in Python.
